# Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2018

In this <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018'>competition</a> we need to identify the cell's nuclei by segmenting them from the given image.

I have used Pytorch to implement a dilated U-net. As this competition is still under progress, this is not my final solution.
